# fiveamstudy HTTP Server

This repository contains the HTTP server that will eventually serve [fiveamstudy.com](https://fiveamstudy.com).

## About

Built live on stream as part of the [Five AM Study](https://www.youtube.com/@thefiveamstudy) system, this server is a real-world, from-scratch implementation of a basic HTTP server written in Go.

It’s designed not just as an exercise, but as the foundation for hosting the Five AM Study website and future tools built for the learning and engineering community.

## Live Progress

All progress is streamed live at 5 AM CET as part of the Five AM Study project.  
Catch the sessions [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thefiveamstudy) or join the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mcUFJpnNRh).

## Why?

Because I believe in learning systems by **building them in public** —  
not just following tutorials, but shipping real infrastructure, one commit at a time.
